    <h2>Proposal</h2>
    <h3>Skin Disease Detection Through Machine Learning</h3>
    <h3>Members</h3>
    <p>1. Raja Rehan Ahmed</p>
    <p>2. Muhammad Zain Ul Abideen</p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Skin diseases are more common than other diseases. Skin diseases may be caused by fungal 
infection, bacteria, allergy, or viruses, etc. A skin disease may change texture or color of the skin. In 
general, skin diseases are chronic, infectious and sometimes may develop into skin cancer. Therefore, 
skin diseases must be diagnosed early to reduce their development and spread. The diagnosis and 
treatment of a skin disease takes longer time and causes financial and physical cost to the patient.
Therefore, we propose an image processing-based approach to diagnose the skin diseases. This method 
takes the digital image of disease effect skin area then use image analysis to identify the type of disease. 
Our proposed approach is simple, fast and does not require expensive equipment's other than a camera 
and a computer.
    </p>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
     To design a skin disease detection system which allow people to detect which type of disease they 
have, level of disease and type of disease. It also helps doctors and other medical staff.

    </p>
    <h3>Problem Description</h3>
    <p>
      The extraction of features plays a key role in helping to classify skin diseases. Computer vision has a 
role in the detection of skin diseases in a variety of techniques. This work contributes in the research of 
skin disease detection. We proposed an image processing-based method to detect skin diseases. This 
method takes the digital image of disease effect skin area, then use image analysis to identify the type of 
disease. Our proposed approach is simple, fast and does not require expensive equipment other than a 
camera and a computer. The approach works on the inputs of a color image. Then resize the of the 
image to extract features using pretrained convolutional neural network.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      Our proposed approach is simple, fast and does not require expensive equipment other than a 
camera and a computer. The approach works on the inputs of a color image. Then resize the of the 
image to extract features using pretrained convolutional neural network. After that classified feature 
using Multiclass SVM. Finally, the results are shown to the user, including the type of disease, spread, 
and severity.

    </p>
    <h3>Project Scope</h3>
    <p>
     This project will be a web-based project. Different users can use it on their own device. The dataset will 
used. The convolutional neural network extract features from the image and then show the results.
    </p>
    <h3>Tools/Technology</h3>
    <p>
      1.Software • Python (Django) • PyCharm • MySQL • HTML/CSS • Visual Studio
      Code 2.Hardware • Laptop • Camera
    </p>
    <h3>Expertise of the Team Members</h3>
    <p>
      The project is of equal interest to both team members. Both team members
      are pre-equipped with the level of knowledge needed for the successful
      completion of this project and have studied the relevant courses as well.
